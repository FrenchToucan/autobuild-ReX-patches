**July 18 2024 - Inotia00 came back to Revanced Extended recently and now his builds are available here: https://github.com/revanced-apks/build-apps/. As a result, the builds in this repo are no longer of value.**

**Reddit Revanced Extended APKs**

This repo builds APKs for Reddit Revanced Extended using patches provided by [YT-Advanced](https://github.com/YT-Advanced/ReX-patches). It exists only because [revanced-apks](https://github.com/revanced-apks/build-apps) doesnâ€™t include Reddit Revanced Extended which has a much more useful feature set than regular Reddit Revanced.

Thanks to [YT-Advanced](https://github.com/YT-Advanced) for supporting Extended after the legendary [inotia00](https://github.com/inotia00) archived his Extended repos. Thanks to [j-hc](https://github.com/inotia00) for the amazing auto-building Github routines. And, of course, thank you to the [Revanced](https://github.com/revanced) group.
